            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The idea for this project was to create a game using code. I was always fascinated on how developers create massive titles and release 
            them out using different coding languages to do so. I therefore wanted to create a small game project to see if I could create one too.
            My favourite genre of game is RPGs and so I wanted to create a turn based action game using python/pygame only.</p>
            <p>I created my own sprites for the main character that the user plays and the enemy to beat. I create a series of 8-bit images which
            cycle through depending on what animation is being played. I created animations for the characters being idle, their attacking animations
            and their defeat animations. </p>
