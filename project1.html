            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The idea for this project was to create a game using code. I was always fascinated on how developers create massive titles and release 
            them out using different coding languages to do so. I therefore wanted to create a small game project to see if I could create one too.
            My favourite genre of game is RPGs and so I wanted to create a turn based action game using python/pygame only.</p>

            <p>The first gif shows what the user sees when opening the game. They must press space to go into the main menu and from there, they 
            can navigate through it to select: making a new game, continuing from their previous game and selecting the enemy they want to battle.
            The second gif shows the combat where each side can attack and the user can use limited potions at the bottom to restore health, after
            the user wins, they level up which increases their damage and health so if the fight was repeated, it would be easier.</p>
            
            <p>I created my own sprites for the main character that the user plays and the enemy to beat. I create a series of 8-bit images which
            cycle through depending on what animation is being played. I created animations for the characters being idle, their attacking animations
            and their defeat animations. </p>
